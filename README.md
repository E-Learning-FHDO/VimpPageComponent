VimpPageComponent
============
### Description
This is an open source project forked from https://github.com/fluxapps/VimpPageComponent

This is an additional Plugin for the ViMP Plugin, thus it only works with ViMP installed (see https://github.com/E-Learning-FHDO/ViMP).
It allows you to add videos from ViMP in any Text-Media-Editor in ILIAS.

### Installation
Start at your ILIAS root directory
```bash
mkdir -p Customizing/global/plugins/Services/COPage/PageComponent/
cd Customizing/global/plugins/Services/COPage/PageComponent
git clone https://github.com/E-Learning-FHDO/VimpPageComponent.git
```
As ILIAS administrator go to "Administration->Plugins" and install/activate the plugin.
